# Reading List 

This repo houses a working reading list to help keep track of what I'm reading and future books I'd like to read. 

I want to this be more collaborative, so submit PRs with suggestions for reading. :)

[Ryan's](https://github.com/Gusbenz) Summer Reads:

• [Remote: Office Not Required](http://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501) **Jason Fried**

• [Stuff Matters](http://www.amazon.com/Stuff-Matters-Exploring-Marvelous-Materials/dp/0544483944/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1464525783&sr=8-1&keywords=Stuff+Matters) **Mark Miodownik** 

• [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) **William Gibson**

• [Green Mars & Blue Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy) **Kim Stanley Robinson** (I've finished 'Red Mars' just recently!)

I suggest following [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/books/12-new-books-were-reading-this-summer-and-6-not-so-new.html?mabReward=R4&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&region=CColumn&module=Recommendation&src=rechp&WT.nav=RecEngine) format if you're going to blog post it or something. 

Anyway, cool idea. Would make a fun site if updated all summer. Always fun to see what people claim they're reading! :)
